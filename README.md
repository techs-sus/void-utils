## Why I made this

I feel that the void community doesn't have good enough script utilties to use.
So, I made a repository with all the great void utilities I use!
Have fun scripting!

## Included utilities

>Read the scripts.

- binder.lua
- limit_bypass.lua
- fetcher.lua (this one fetches these things above)
